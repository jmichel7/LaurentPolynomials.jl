# LaurentPolynomials
Univariate (Laurent) polynomials and rational fractions.

This  package  implements  univariate  Laurent  polynomials, and univariate
rational  fractions. The  coefficients can  be in  any ring  (possibly even
non-commutative, like `Matrix{Int}`).

See the docs for usage and comparison with `Polynomials.jl`.
